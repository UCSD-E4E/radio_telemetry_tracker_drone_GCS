# Using Poetry

## 1. Set Up the Project Environment

Ensure your project is initialized with Poetry. If you havenâ€™t already, run:

```sh
poetry install
```

This installs all dependencies specified in your `pyproject.toml` and sets up a virtual environment.

## 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the Poetry-managed virtual environment:

```sh
poetry shell
```

## 3. Run Your Code

You can run your Python script directly using Poetry:

```sh
poetry run python main.py
```
